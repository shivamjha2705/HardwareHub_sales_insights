## Project Overview

HardwareHub, a well-known company specializing in hardware peripherals, faced a significant challenge. Despite rapid expansion, the company experienced a decline in sales, and the cause was unclear. By leveraging data analytics and visualization, we aimed to uncover the hidden truths within the company's data and provide actionable insights to reverse the sales decline.

## The Crisis at HardwareHub

HardwareHub, headquartered in Delhi, India, with regional offices across the country, struggled with declining sales due to uncoordinated reports and outdated data collection methods. Sales Director Rohit Kumar and his colleague, Jeet Vidhyarthi, were under pressure to address the issue.

## The Traditional Approach

Previously, HardwareHub relied on Excel files for managing data. District managers sent in large spreadsheets with sales figures and other metrics. This method was overwhelming and often masked real issues due to overly optimistic reports.

## Enter the Data Analyst

Recognizing the need for a more efficient way to handle data, HardwareHub brought in a data analystâ€”me. My goal was to uncover hidden truths within the company's data and provide actionable insights to reverse the sales decline.

## The Power of Visualization

The key to solving HardwareHub's problems lay in visualizing the data. Instead of sifting through endless rows of numbers in Excel, I created interactive dashboards to present the data clearly and concisely. These visualizations highlighted top products, customers, revenue trends, and more, providing instant insights.
