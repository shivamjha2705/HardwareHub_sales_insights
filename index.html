            <h2>The Crisis at HardwareHub</h2>
            <p class="text">
              HardwareHub, a well-known company specializing in hardware
              peripherals, faced a significant challenge. Headquartered in the
              bustling city of Delhi, India, and with regional offices across
              the country, the company had grown considerably. However, this
              rapid expansion brought an unexpected problem: sales were
              dropping, and the cause was unclear <br />
              <br />The Sales Director, <strong>Rohit Kumar</strong>, and his
              colleague, <strong>Jeet Vidhyarthi</strong>, were under tremendous
              pressure. Managing a small team had been easy, but now, with a
              large network of employees and customers, they were struggling.
              The reason for the decline in sales was buried under a mountain of
              uncoordinated reports and outdated data collection methods.

            <h2>The Traditional Approach</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Previously, HardwareHub relied on Excel files for managing data.
              District managers would send in large spreadsheets with sales
              figures and other metrics. This method had its flaws. The large
              volume of data was overwhelming, making it hard to extract
              meaningful insights. Plus, district managers often provided overly
              optimistic reports, masking the real issues.<br />
              <br />Rohit Kumar found himself overwhelmed by the deluge of Excel
              files. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't make sense of the
              data.
              <strong
                >The gap between what was reported and the actual situation was
                growing</strong
              >, and the company urgently needed a better solution.

            <h2>Enter the Data Analyst - ME üëâüòéüßë‚Äçüíª</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Recognizing the dire need for a more efficient and accurate way to
              handle data, HardwareHub brought in a data analyst‚Äîme.
              <strong
                >My goal was clear: to uncover the hidden truths within the
                company's data and provide actionable insights that could
                reverse the sales decline.</strong
              ><br />
              <br />Working closely with Manager and Stakeholders, I gathered
              all the data from company's database and embarked on a journey to
              transform HardwareHub's data management practices.

              The Power of Visualization
            </h2>
            <p class="text">
              The key to solving HardwareHub's problems lay in visualizing the
              data. Instead of sifting through endless rows of numbers in Excel,
              I aimed to create interactive dashboards that could present the
              data in a clear and concise manner. These visualizations would
              highlight the <b>top five products</b>, <b>top five customers</b>,
              <b>revenue trends</b>, and more, providing instant insights at a
              glance.<br /><br />My goal was to create a dashboard that would
              serve as a single source of truth for the company. With this tool,
              Rohit Kumar and his team could easily identify problem areas,
              understand sales trends, and make data-driven decisions. The days
              of relying on outdated Excel files would be over, replaced by
              dynamic, real-time visualizations.
